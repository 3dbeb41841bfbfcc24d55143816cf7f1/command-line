# The CLI (Command Line Interface)

## Learning Objectives

### Concepts

- Compare and contrast CLIs / GUIs
- Explain how command line usage can increase efficiency
- Describe the anatomy of a command (statement, flags, arguments)
- Explain what a path is, and why the 'current path' is important in the CLI
- Explain the difference between an absolute path and a relative path

### Mechanics

- Setup your working directory / environment for WDI
- List common commands to
  - View the path of the current directory
  - View the contents of a directory
  - Navigate to different directories
  - Manage files and directories
- Open files and directories with Atom
- List unsafe commands

## Framing

Turn & Talk: Given your exposure to the command line so far (prework and
installfest), discuss the following questions:

* How is the CLI different from the GUI?
* What do you like / dislike about using it?
* It what ways might it be better or worse for Developers? (Compared to a GUI)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why The CLI?

The CLI has many benefits over a GUI:

**Speed**
While it may not seem so yet, over time, most developers can achieve common
tasks much faster using the command line. Features such as tab completion,
history searching / modifying, and piping commands all contribute to this speed.

**Precision**
Because of its nature as a text-based interface, the command line provides us
with a lot more precision. We can look at the commands we're about to enter
and understand exactly what they will do. This also allows:

**Repeatability / Scriptability**
The precision of commands and their text-based nature means we can easily save
them and re-use them, or share them with others when appropriate. If you think
back to the commands you ran during installfest, those were basically a set of
scripts that we had you run.

**Tools**
There are a very large number of tools available on the command line, to help
us achieve almost any task. Most of them are built in, but we can download
almost any others using `brew` on a mac, or `apt-get` on linux.

Additionally, tools built for the command line usually follow something called
the ['unix philosophy'](http://catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/#id2807216), which is that each tool should do ~1 thing, and do it
well. Complex tasks can be achieved by chaining tools together.

## Basics of CLI

You may already be familiar with some of these concepts, but it's worth
reviewing them now, cementing the concepts and getting some more practice in.

### Everything is a command

First things first, on the command line, everything we enter into the command
line is a **command**. When we hit enter, the command is executed.

### Commands have output and side effects

Some commands have **output**, which is displayed on the screen for us to see.
Examples of commands that have output might be:

* `pwd`
* `ls`
* `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl`

Other commands primarily exist to have a *side-effect*, or in other words, to
make some change, usually on our system. An example might be `touch`, which
creates a new file.

Note that often times, a command whose main job is a side effect may not provide
any output if it succeeds. If there is an error it will provide output.

Rarely, some commands may provide both an output and side effects.

### Command Syntax (Flags and Arguments)

**See `haircut` command for demo.**

    $ ./haircut --mohawk adrian

Commands generally consist of three parts, the command, followed by flags (aka
options), and finally arguments.


The **command** is the first 'word', e.g. `ls`, `cd`, or `touch`. It is like the
verb, which says generally, 'what do I want to do'.

Next come the **flags** or **options**. These are optional; you may not use them
for some commands. As the name implies, they set options to tell the command
**how** to do what it's about to do. There may be zero or more options. Options
usually start with one or two dashes. Usually one dash is for a short one letter
abbreviation, while two dashes is for long name for the option.

http://catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch10s05.html#id2948149

Finally come the arguments. These are what you want to do the action to. Usually
these are file names, but they could be URLs, or other things.

### Commands run in an 'environment'

We won't go deep into environments yet, but everytime a command is run, it may
choose to look at what are called `environment variables`. These are essentially
variables that are semi-permanent and can provide information or options to help
a command do its job.

## Paths
### What is a 'path'?

A path is the description that tells us (or a computer) where a file or folder
is on our computer.

Our terminal (shell) is always working out of a single path at a time. Commands
that are run will take action in the current path (directory) unless we tell
them to do otherwise.

### Relative vs Absolute Paths

All paths point to a single file or folder, but we can write paths to be either
**relative** or **absolute**.

#### Absolute Paths

An absolute path will always tell us exactly where the file or folder is. An
example in the real world would be a mailing address:

GA
8th Floor
1133 15th St NW
Washington, DC 20003
USA
Earth
Solar System
Milky Way

Absolute paths start with a `/` and go from top down (least specific to more specific):

```bash
/Milky_Way/Solar_System/Earth/USA/Washington_DC/1133_15th_St_NW/8th_Floor/GA
# or a realistic example
/Users/adambray/code/work/general_assembly/courses/wdi/dc/dc7/curriculum/01-front-end/
```

The first slash essentially means "start at the root of the computer's file system".

Some absolute paths instead start with a `~`. This is a shortcut to the absolute
path of our home directory. So the above absolute path could also be written as

```
~/code/work/general_assembly/courses/wdi/dc/dc7/curriculum/01-front-end/
```

#### Relative Paths

Relative paths are interpreted starting from the directory we're in (aka the
current working directory).

They start with anything but a slash `/` or a tilde `~`.

So if I were in my home directory, the path to my work folder could be written

```bash
code/work                     # relative
~/code/work                   # absolute
/users/adambray/code/work/    # absolute
```

If I were in a different folder, then the relative path would point to an
entirely different folder/file.

Periods or dots are special in relative paths:
* One dot means "relative to the current directory"
* Two dots means "go up to the parent directory"

So if I'm in `~/code/work` then the relative path `../personal_projects` means
"go up one level to the code folder, then down into personal_projects".

We can use multiple `..` to go up multiple levels:

`../../documents/top_secret/lol_cats/favorites/so_many_kittenz.jpg` would go up
two levels, from `~/code/work` to `~` (my home directory), and then down into
my favorite lolcat picture.

## Common Commands

### Getting help / info

There are three general ways to get help with a command.

* add `--help` or `-h` to the end of the command. e.g. `brew --help`
* use the `man` tool (manual), e.g. `man brew`
* search google

### Common Command Teachbacks

Form groups of ~3 and spend 15 minutes researching and preparing a short demo
of your command. Focus on:

* what it does
* common uses
* common flags or arguments
* any 'gotchas'?

#### Commands

* tab completion
* ls
* cd
* touch / mkdir
* cp
* mv
* rm
* atom

## Unsafe Commands

### sudo

`sudo` runs the command that follows as the SuperUser, aka 'root' or 'admin'.
This means the command could potentially have destructive effects.

Generally, you shouldn't need to run commands with sudo in this course. If
you're not sure, ask an instructor.


### rm

`rm` deletes files with no confirmation, and there's no `trash` to recover them
from. Use `rm`, and especially `rm -rf` with caution.

## WDI Environment

### Directory Structure

Here's the suggested structure for your WDI folder. Please create the following
folders if they do not exist.

  * ~/wdi
    * sandbox
    * exercises
    * curriculum
    * projects
