# Episode 5: A New Terminal

A long time ago in a unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to enterâ€¦ The Terminal.

## Terminal Commands

- `cd <directory_path>`: change directories
  - `cd ~/` : go to user directory
  - `cd ../` : go up one directory
- `ls -l <directory_path>`: lists visible files in a directory
  - `ls -la <directory_path>`: lists ALL files in a directory
- `mv <filepath> <new_filepath>`: moves/renames files
- `mkdir <directory_name>`: make a new directory
- `rmdir <directory_name>`: remove an empty directory
- `touch <filepath>`: create a new empty file
- `rm <filepath>`: removes a file
  - `rm -r`: removes all files in a directory
  - `rm -rf`: forcibly removes a directory and all its files
- `subl <filepath>`: opens a file in Sublime Text

## Going to the Dark Side
Place your hands on your keyboard, and let the Force flow through your finger tips. No touching your mousepad!

1. Open the **Terminal app** (use Spotlight)
2. Change directories to your **Desktop**.
3. Create a new file called "**skywalker.txt**".
4. Rename Skywalker to "**vader.txt**".
5. Create a new desktop folder called "**Deathstar**".
6. Move Vader *into* the Deathstar.
7. List the contents of Deathstar to confirm that Vader is onboard.
8. Create a new desktop folder called "**Alderaan**".
9. Enter the Alderaan directory.
10. Create three news files: "**.voice1**", "**.voice2**", "**.voice3**".
11. List the voices of Alderaan in the terminal.
12. Open each voice in Sublime Text, and save their contents as:
	- "**terror!**"
	- "**Terror!**"
	- "**TERROR!**"
13. Return to the desktop, and blow up Alderaan with a single command.
14. Move Vader back *out of* the Deathstar.
15. Blow up the Deathstar.
